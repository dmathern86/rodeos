Welcome to the NeuVector Rodeo.

In this scenario, we will be walking through installing NeuVector and testing its features.

This scenario will be following the general installation instructions available here: [NeuVector documentation](https://open-docs.neuvector.com).

We will be using one virtual machine today, `kubernetes01` which is located in the tabs in the panel to the right. `kubernetes01` will run a Kubernetes cluster and NeuVector.
