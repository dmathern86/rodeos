NeuVector can also visualize the network communication in your cluster.

The **Network activity** section will show you a graph with every Pod as a node and the network activity shown as arrows between them.

You can see that the WordPress Pod node is shown green, because it is in protect mode. It has a red circle around it, because it is currently quarantined. And you see the allowed network activity in blue and the blocked activity in red.

The graph is also filterable which can be handy in larger clusters.
