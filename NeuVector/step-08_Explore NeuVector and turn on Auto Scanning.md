Now, we can explore NeuVector. This initial view upon logging in is the main dashboard screen, which will lead us to various parts of the platform.

First, we'll enable the Auto Scanning feature. In the navigation menu under **Assets -> Nodes** there is an "Auto Scan" toggle on the top right. Click the toggle to turn this on.

This enables the scanning feature for all containers currently running on the system, as well as any subsequent deployments. CIS and compliance scans are also run on the nodes themselves, as well as kubernetes.

In the next step, we will view the results of the scanning activity.
