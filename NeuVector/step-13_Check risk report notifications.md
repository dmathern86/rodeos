Every time a new CVE or compliance violation has been discovered, NeuVector will also send out a notification. These are viewed under **Notifications -> Risk Reports**. Every configuration change in NeuVector is recorded under **Notifications -> Events**.
NeuVector also supports sending these notifications to external systems via Syslog or Webhooks.

You can find more information at [Reporting and Notifications](https://open-docs.neuvector.com/reporting/reporting).
